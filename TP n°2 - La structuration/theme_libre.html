            <h2 id="NES">Nintendo entertainment Sytem (1983)</h2>
            <p>Released July 15, 1983, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game console released
                by
                Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa and was Nintendo's first home
                video game console released outside Japan. In Japan, it is known as the "Family Computer" (or "Famicom",
                as
                it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video
                game
                industry following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles in
                everything
                from game design to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly
                courted third-party developers. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda
                and
                Metroid were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October
                31,
                2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary
                parts.</p>

            <h2 id="SNES">Super Nintendo (1990)</h2>
            <p>Released November 21, 1990, The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, officially abbreviated the Super NES
                or
                SNES and colloquially shortened to Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit video game console released by Nintendo
                in
                North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa. In Japan it is known as the Super
                Famicom.
                In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.
                The SNES was Nintendo's third home console(second outside of Japan), following the Nintendo
                Entertainment
                System. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of Asia, the SNES
                was a
                global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and North
                America—due in part to increased competition from Sega's Genesis console. Despite its relatively late
                start,
                the SNES became the best selling console of the 16-bit era, selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.[6]
                The
                SNES library is known for upgrading some of Nintendo's most famous franchises, and making the games even
                more critically acclaimed, such as Super Metroid, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy
                IV
                and VI, Donkey Kong Country, and Super Mario World, as well starting some popular franchises such as
                Star
                Fox and Mega Man X.
                Similarly to the NES Classic Edition released prior, Nintendo released a software-emulation-based
                version of
                the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on September 29, 2017. Called the Super NES Classic Edition, it,
                like its predecessor, is a dedicated console that comes with two controllers and 21 preloaded games, one
                of
                which, Star Fox 2, is a title originally developed for the system that went unreleased.[7] </p>

            <h2 id="N64">Nintendo 64 (1996)</h2>
            <p>t was released on June 23, 1996 in Japan, on September 29, 1996, in North America, and March 1, 1997, in
                Europe and Australia. the Nintendo 64, commonly called the N64, and codenamed Ultra 64, was Nintendo's
                third
                home video game console for the international market. It was released with three launch games in Japan
                (Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 and Saikyo Habu Shogi) and two in North America (Super Mario 64 and
                Pilotwings 64). PAL regions also had three launch titles (Super Mario 64, Shadows of the Empire and
                Pilotwings 64) with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter delayed until three days after launch. Other key games
                included
                Donkey Kong 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo-Kazooie, two games in The Legend of Zelda series, GoldenEye
                007,
                Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros., and Star Fox 64. The Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million systems.[6]</p>

            <h2 id="GC">GameCube (2001)</h2>
            <p>The Nintendo GameCube (commonly shortened to GameCube, NGC, or GCN) was released on November 5, 2001. It
                was
                Nintendo's sixth generation game console, the same generation as Sega's Dreamcast, Sony's PlayStation 2,
                and
                Microsoft's Xbox. Until the console's unveiling at SpaceWorld 2000, the design project was known as
                Dolphin—this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the
                most
                compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use optical discs
                rather
                than game cartridges. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer Matsushita led to a DVD-playing
                GameCube system named the Panasonic Q, which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up
                centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros.
                Melee, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, Pokémon Colosseum, and Star Fox Adventures, while
                new
                franchises like Animal Crossing and Pikmin were born, although the former franchise had seen a
                Japan-exclusive release on the N64. The GameCube has sold 21.74 million units.[6]</p>

            <h2 id="WII">Wii (2006)</h2>
            <p>The Wii was released on November 19, 2006, as Nintendo's seventh-generation home console. Nintendo
                designed
                the console to appeal towards a wider audience than those of its main competitors, the PlayStation 3 and
                Xbox 360, including "casual" players and audiences that were new to video games.[8][9]
                These aims were emphasized by the console's distinguishing feature, the Wii Remote—a handheld motion
                controller that can detect motion and rotation in three dimensions, using a mixture of internal sensors
                and
                infrared positioning. The controller includes an expansion port that can be used to connect other
                accessories, such as the Nunchuk—an attachment with an analog stick and additional buttons, a "Classic
                Controller" gamepad providing a traditional control scheme, and Wii MotionPlus—an accessory designed to
                enhance the motion detection capabilities of the original Wii Remote models.[8][9] </p>

            <h2 id="WIIU">Wii U (2012)</h2>
            <p>The Wii U was released on November 18, 2012 as a direct successor to the Wii, and the first entry in the
                eighth generation of home video game consoles. The Wii U's distinguishing hardware feature is the
                GamePad, a
                tablet-like controller which contains a touchscreen that wirelessly streams a video output from the
                console.
                The GamePad's display can be used to provide alternative or complementary perspectives within a game, or
                as
                the main display in lieu of a television.[15][16] In particular, Nintendo promoted the concept of
                "asymmetric" multiplayer, where a player with the GamePad would have a different objective and
                perspective
                than that of other players.[17] Alongside the GamePad, the Wii U supports Wii controllers and games. A
                conventional gamepad known as the Wii U Pro Controller was also released.[18][19][16]
                The Wii U features more-extensive online functionality than the Wii, using the Nintendo Network
                platform; as
                with the Wii, it supports online multiplayer and downloading and purchasing new games and apps, but also
                allows video chat. It previously featured an internal social network known as Miiverse, which allowed
                users
                to write and draw posts in game-specific communities, the service was discontinued on November 8,
                2017.[20][21][22][23] Nintendo also attempted to provide second screen experiences for television
                programming for the Wii U through a feature known as Nintendo TVii,[24][25] but it was discontinued
                outside
                of Japan in August 2015.[26] Unlike the Wii, the Wii U's hardware is capable of high-definition
                graphics.[16] </p>

            <h2 id="SWITCH">Switch (2017)</h2>
            <p>The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo and released worldwide in
                most
                regions on March 3, 2017. The console itself is a tablet that can either be docked for use as a home
                console
                or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, with
                standard
                buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach
                to
                both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also connect to a grip accessory to
                provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote
                and
                Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports online gaming
                through
                Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo
                Switch
                games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution
                via
                Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout.[n] A handheld-focused revision of the system, called
                the
                Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019. A revised higher-end version of the original
                system, featuring an OLED screen, was released on October 8, 2021. </p>
